# Simple-chat

This is a very simple chat application I made that allows for chatting using no account.

## Screenshots

This application allows you to join private servers or the public server.

It allows anyone to create private servers, which are automatically deleted every time the last person leaves.

Server owners are allowed to create and delete channels.

They can also change the permissions of other users so they can create and delete channels.
